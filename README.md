  ## Description:
  The motivation behind this project was to create the backend for a social network API that uses MongoDB. Users of this social network can share their thoughts and react to their friends' thoughts. This project uses [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express), [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose), and [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) npm packages. Routes were tested with Insomnia. <br /><br /> For seeding of this database, the [random-email](https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-email) npm package was used for creating emails and quotes from Alan Watts, sourced from [his website](https://alanwatts.org/quotes/), were used to create users' thoughts. <br /><br />  For future development of this project, I would like to rework the seed.js and data.js to fix a few bugs.
