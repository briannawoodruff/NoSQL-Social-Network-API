  ## Description:
  The motivation behind this project was to create the backend for a social network API that uses MongoDB. Users of this social network can share their thoughts and react to their friends' thoughts. This project uses [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express), [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose), and [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) npm packages and [random-email](https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-email) for seeding the database. Routes were tested with Insomnia. <br /><br />  For future development of this project, I would like to rework the seed.js and data.js to fix a few bugs.
